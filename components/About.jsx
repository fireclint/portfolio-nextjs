            I have spent the last 12 years in the fire service working as a
            professional firefighter/paramedic. I have always had a knack for
            technology and working with computers. In 2019 I started working
            with HTML and CSS to make some minor edits on a small business
            website that I was operating. What I thought was just a few small
            edits turned into a love for programming.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            Fascinated with how intricate programming can be I was quickly drawn
            to learn more. I started learning javascript and was even more
            enthused with making websites interactive. I then started
            freelancing for e-commerce companies on the Shopify platform. I am
            now spending my time building projects with React JS, Firebase, and
            learning new technologies.
