          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications
            that connect with API’s and other backend technologies. I’m
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
            in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and
            React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
          </p>

            I started web developement in 2013 managing multiple e-commerce
            websites on CMS platforms such as WordPress, BigCommerce, and
            Shopify. I have experience working directly with clients and taking
            mock wireframes all the way to deployed applications. In my spare
            time I run Code Commerce, a Youtube channel where I teach web
            developement and various front-end technologies.
